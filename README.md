### Our service is a simple tool that helps users that are in urgent situations to send SMS messages to their family and friends to notify them that you are in need of help.

### Features
- Import existing contacts into a list of emergency contacts which our service will use to automatically send SMS messages to by pressing the blue + button in the "Contacts" page
- You can drag contacts to reorder the priority in which they are contacted, swipe to remove from emergency contacts, and customize the message to send.
- PUSH will also include periodic location and timestamp updates if you choose to opt in in the "Customize" Page by checking the check boxes
- Emergency contacts and SOS message are stored locally on the device so no one else has access to them.

### How to use

1. When you are in an emergency, hold down the beige/blue outlined button to start a countdown and animation for 6 seconds
2. After the countdown and animation completes, PUSH will begin a foreground service that periodically sends SMS messages to your imported emergency contacts
3. PUSH will send one SMS message every 30 seconds to your emergency contacts by priority based on how you ordered them in the list.
4. Once PUSH has reached the end of the list, it will repeat and restart from the top of the list until the user has pressed the cancel button and confirmed that they want to stop the service.
5. The service will also stop if the app is removed from the background tasks by the use
